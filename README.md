# Damping Oscillation with Python
The main objective of the project is to visualize the damping oscillation by
solving the second order differential equation using numerical method (Euler’s
method) using Pycharm software (a Python IDE). In this project we have used the
second order differential equation of damping oscillation and solved it with the
help of the Euler’s method of numerical integration, and with the help of the
Vpython we have created a model of the spring mass oscillator and by creating a
loop where we will use the solution of the differential equation to assign the bob
values such as positions and velocity so that we can witness a oscillatory motion of
the system. Further we will change some physical parameter of the spring such as
damping constant and force constant and see the changes in the oscillatory motion
of the system. Finally will plot ‘time vs displacement’ graph for the clear
understanding of the Damping oscillation.
